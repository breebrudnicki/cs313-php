        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Bree Carrick and this is my website. My major is Web Design and Development with an emphasis in Development and a minor in Design. I'm from Portland Oregon and while I love going to school at BYU-Idaho, Oregon has my heart. Some of my favorite things to do include hiking, Pinterest, crafts, making spreadsheets, organizing things, and eating. My favorite food is cookie dough.</p>
